       "  'poem_string': 'Double Dealer appeared some translations by him of\\nLaforgue, which seemed to me very fine; I looked up pre-\\nvious numbers of the magazine, and found Black Tam-\\nbourine, an early poem that contained some of the char-\\nacteristic features of his later and mature style. I had\\nseen nothing like it in Anglo-American poetry. From that\\ntime until his death one could trace the development of a\\npoetry which, though similar in some technical respects to\\nFrench Symbolism, is now a distinct contribution to\\nAmerican literature. It is a poetry that could have been\\nwritten only in this country and in this age.\\nCrane committed suicide on April 28, 1932, by jumping\\noff the S. S. Orizaba bound from Vera Cruz to New York.\\nWhy he did it no one will ever know. He had recently\\nheard that his father’s estate in Cleveland, from which he\\nderived an income, was bankrupt: a year ago he told a\\nfriend in New York that his work was at anend. In the\\nsummer of 1930 he wrote to me that he feared his most\\nambitious work, The Bridge, was not quite perfectly\\nrealized, that probably his soundest work was in the\\nshorter pieces of White Buildings, but that his mind being\\ncommitted to the larger undertaking could never return to\\nthe purely lyrical and more fragmentary vision. He had\\nan extraordinary insight into the foundations of his work,\\nand I think this judgment of it will never be refuted.\\nIf he had lived another month my acquaintance with\\nhim would have covered exactly ten years. In most of\\nthat time I was either in frequent correspondence with him\\nor lived near him in New York; from 1922 to 1928, when I\\nwent abroad and saw him and heard from him irregularly\\nuntil his death, I could observe the development of his\\nstyle from poem to poem; and his letters—always written\\nin a pure and lucid prose—provide a valuable commentary\\non his career. This is not the time to bring all this\\nmaterial together for judgment. As I look back upon his\\nwork and its relation to the life he lived, a general state-\\nment about it occurs to me, which may throw some light\\non the dissatisfaction that he felt with his career.\\nThe Bridge is presumably an epic. How early he had\\nconceived the idea of the poem, and the leading symbol-\\nism, it is difficult to know; probably early in 1924. Up to\\nthat time, with the exception of For the Marriage of\\nFaustus and Helen (1922), he had written only short poems,\\nbut most of them—Praise for an Urn, Black Tambourine,\\nParaphrase, and Emblems of Conduct, are among his finest\\nworks. It is a mistake to suppose that all of White Build-\\nings is early experimental writing; a large portion of that\\nvolume, and perhaps the least successful part of it, is\\nmade up of poems written after The Bridge was begun.\\nPraise for an Urn was written in the spring of 1922—one of\\nthe finest elegies ever written by an American poet—and\\nalthough his later development gave us a poetry that the\\nperiod would be much the less rich for not having, he never\\nagain had such perfect mastery of his subject. And I think\\nthis was because he never afterwards knew precisely what\\nhis subject was. That is why The Bridge is such a magnifi-\\ncent failure: a great talent is engaged upon the problem\\nof stating a position that is fundamentally incapable of\\ndefinition.\\nReaders familiar with For the Marriage of Faustus and\\nHelen have always admired it by passages, but the whole\\nconception of the poem, logically speaking, is an abstrac-\\ntion empty of any well-defined experience, and in its\\nverbal properties it is a conventional revival of the kind\\nof symbolism that a young poet picks up in his first read-\\ning. Crane, I believe, felt that this was so; and he became\\nso dissatisfied, not only with the style of the poem, which\\nis heavily influenced by Eliot and Laforgue, but with the\\n“literary” character of the symbolism, that he set about\\nthe greater task of writing The Bridge. He looked upon\\nhis Faustus and Helen as an answer to the historical\\npessimism of the school of Eliot, and The Bridge was to be\\nan even more complete answer.\\nThere was a fundamental mistake in Crane’s diagnosis\\nof Eliot’s problem. Eliot’s “‘pessimism” grows out of an\\nawareness of the decay of the individual consciousness and\\nits fixed relations to the world; but Crane thought that it\\nwas due to something like pure “orneryness,” an unwilling-\\nness “‘to share with us the breath released,” a new kind of\\nfreedom which he identified emotionally with the age of\\nthe machine. This vagueness of purpose, in spite of the\\napparently concrete character of the Brooklyn Bridge,\\nwhich became the symbol of his epic, he never succeeded in\\ncorrecting. The “bridge” stands for no well-defined\\nexperience; it differs from the Helen and Faust symbols\\nonly in its unliterary origin. I think Crane was deceived\\nby this, and by the fact that Brooklyn Bridge is “modern”\\nanda fine piece of “mechanics.” His more ambitious later\\nproject permitted him no greater degree of self-definition\\nthan the more literary symbolism of his youth.\\nIt has always seemed to me that by testing out his\\ncapacity to construct a great objective piece of work, in\\nwhich his own definition of himself should have been per-\\nfectly articulated, he brought his work to anend. I think\\nhe knew that the framework of The Bridge was finally\\nincoherent, and for that reason—as I have said—he could\\nno longer believe in even his lyrical powers; he could not\\nreturn to the early work and take it up where he had left\\noff. Far from “refuting” Eliot, his whole career is a\\nvindication of Eliot’s major premise—that the integrity of\\nthe individual consciousness has broken down. In the final\\nanalysis, Crane had, in his later work, no individual con-\\nsciousness: the hard firm style of Praise for an Urn, which\\nis based upon a clear-cut definition of personal relations,\\nand the ultimate inviolability of persons, begins to dis-\\nappear when the poet goes out into the world and finds\\nthat the simplicity of his early world has no universal\\nsanction. From then on, instead of the effort to define\\nhimself in the midst of overwhelming complications—a\\nsituation that might have produced a tragic poet—we\\nthat he falls back upon the intensity of consciousness,\\nrather than the clarity, for his center of writing; and this\\nis simply romanticism.\\nHis world had no center, and the compensatory action\\nthat he took is responsible for the fragmentary quality of\\nhis most ambitious work. This action took two forms—\\nthe blind assertion of the will, and the blind desire for self-\\ndestruction. In either case, the poet will not face his first\\nproblem, which is to define the limits of his personality and\\nto discover its moral properties in an appropriate symbol-\\nism. He can only assert a quality of will against the world,\\nand at each successive failure of the will he can only turn\\nupon himself. In the failure of understanding—and under-\\nstanding, for Dante, was a way of love—the romantic\\nmodern poet of the age of science attempts to impose his\\nwill upon experience and to possess the world.\\nIt is this impulse of the modern period that has given us\\nthe greatest romantic poetry: Crane instinctively con-\\ntinued the conception of the will that was the deliberate\\ndiscovery of Rimbaud. A poetry of the will is a poetry of\\nsensation, for the poet surrenders to his sensations of the\\nobject i in his effort to identify himself with it, and to own\\nit. Some of Crane’s finest lyrics—those written in the\\nperiod of The Bridge—carry the modern impulse as far as\\nyou will find it anywhere in the French romantics.\\nLachrymae Christi and Passage, for example, though on the\\nsurface pure imagery without “philosophical” meaning of\\nthe explicit sort in The Bridge, are the lyrical equivalents\\nof the epic: it is the same mechanism of the sensibility; the\\none defines the other. The implicit grasp of his material\\nthat we find in Praise for an Urn, the poet has exchanged\\nfor an external random symbol that has no possibility of\\ndefinition. It is an irrational symbol of the will, of con-\\nquest, of blind ack Passage,\\nwhose lack of symbolism shows the poetry of the will on\\nthe plane of sensation, which is the self-destructive return\\nof the will upon it:\\nIn the last generation American criticism has had much\\nto say of the frustration of American writers. The\\nassumption seems always to be that their defeat has been\\ndue to failure to accept American life. If there is any\\nAmerican life distinct from the main idea of western\\ncivilization, their failure has been due to their accepting it\\ntoo fully. It is a heresy that rises in a revolt against the\\ntraditional organization of the consciousness—for which\\nthe only substitute offered is the assertion of the will. We\\nhear that Americans are not rooted in the soil, that they\\nmust get rid of the European past before they can be\\nrooted. That is untrue: the only Americans who have ever\\nbeen rooted in the American soil have lived on the\\nEuropean system, socially and spiritually.\\nCrane was the archetype of the modern American poet,\\nwhose fundamental mistake lay in thinking that an\\nirrational surrender of the intellect to the will would be the\\nbasis of a new mentality.

And she bound ivy to his\\nthyrsos,\\nFitted songs to the strings,\\nroses twined in her hands.\\nAnd one among them looked at me with face offended—\\nCalliope:\\n“Content ever to move with white swans!\\nNor will the noise of high horses lead you ever to battle;\\nNor will the public criers ever have your name\\nin their classic horns;\\nNor Mars shout you in the wood at Aeonium,\\nnor where Rome ruins German riches,\\nNor where the Rhine flows with barbarous blood,\\nand flood carries wounded Suevi.\\nObviously, crowned lovers at unknown doors,\\nNight dogs, the marks of a drunken scurry—\\nThese are your images, and from you the sorcerizing\\nof shut-in young ladies,\\nThe wounding of austere men by chicane.”\\nThus Mistress Calliope,\\nDabbling her hands in the fount, thus she\\nStiffened our face with the backwash of Philetas the Coan.\\nIl\\nMidnight, and a letter comes to me from our mistress\\nTelling me to come to Tibur “At once!”\\nBright tips reach up from twin towers,\\nAnienan spring-water falls into flat-spread pools.\\nWhat is to be done about it?\\nShall I entrust myself to entangled shadows\\nWhere bold hands may do violence to my person?\\nYet if I postpone my obedience,\\nbecause of this respectable terror,\\nI shall be prey to lamentations worse than a nocturnal as-\\nsailant.\\nAnd I shall be in the wrong,\\nand it will last a twelve-month,\\nFor her hands have no kindness me-ward,\\nNor is there anyone to whom lovers are not sacred at mid-\\nnight\\nAnd in the Via Sciro,\\nIf any man would be a lover\\ne may walk on the Scythian coast:\\nNo barbarism would go to the extent of doing him harm,\\nThe moon will carry his candle,\\nhe stars will point out the stumbles,\\nCupid will carry lighted torches before him\\nand keep mad dogs off his ankles.\\nThus all roads are perfectly safe\\nand at any hour;\\nWho so indecorous as to shed the pure gore of a suitor?\\nCypris is his cicerone.\\nWhat if undertakers follow my track—\\nsuch a death is worth dying.\\nShe would bring frankincense and wreaths to my tomb,\\nhe would sit like an ornament on my pyre.\\nGods’ aid, let not my bones lie in a public location\\nWith crowds too assiduous in their crossing of it;\\nFor thus are tombs of lovers most desecrated.\\nMay a woody and sequestered place cover me with its foliage\\nOr may I inter beneath the hummock\\nme as yet uncatalogued sand;\\nAt any rate I shall not have my epitaph in a high-road.\\nIv\\nWhen, when, and whenever death closes our eyelids,\\nMoving naked over Acheron\\nUpon the one raft, victor and conquered together,\\nMarius and Jugurtha together,\\nne tangle of shadows.\\nCaesar plots against India—\\nTigris and Euphrates shall from now on flow at his bidding,\\nTibet shall be full of Roman policemen,\\nThe Parthians shall get used to our statuary\\nand acquire a Roman religion:\\nOne raft on the veiled flood of Acheron,\\nMarius and Jugurtha together.\\nNor at my funeral either will there be any long trail,\\nearing ancestral lares and images;\\nNo trumpets filled with my emptiness;\\nNor shall it be on an Attalic bed.\\nThe perfumed cloths shall be absent.\\nA small plebeian procession—\\nEnough, enough, and in plenty.\\nThere will be three books at my obsequies\\nWhich I take, my not unworthy gift, to Persephone.\\nYou will follow the bare scarified breast;\\nNor will you be weary of calling my name, nor too weary\\nTo place the last kiss on my. lips\\nWhen the Syrian onyx is broken.\\n“He who is now vacant dust\\nWas once the slave ‘of one passion” —\\nGive that much inscription—\\n“Death, why tardily come?”\\nYou, sometime, will lament a lost friend,\\nfor it is a custom—\\nThis care for past men—\\nSince Adonis was gored in Idalia, and the Cytherean\\nRan crying with out-spread hair.\\nIn vain you call back the shade;\\nIn vain, Cynthia, vain call to unanswering shadow—\\nsmall talk comes from small bones.\\nEzra Pound',\n",
