    "- In this notebook, I look at the data I scraped from [PoetryFoundation.org](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/) in the previous [notebook](01_webscraping.ipynb).\n",
    "- I check for and rectify duplicate (or near-duplicate) entries, NaN values, and poorly scraped poems.\n",

    "#### Important note\n",
    "As in the [previous notebook](01_webscraping.ipynb), due to the imperfection and idiosyncracies of scraping text from images, a lot of rescraping was necessary. Sometimes this had to be done in a manner that is best described, rather unfortunately, as nonprogrammatic. As a result, this notebook is at times messy, which is not a reflection on the other notebooks for this project.\n",
